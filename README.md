# Overview
[Rugby shop](https://rugby-shop.herokuapp.com/) was built and deployed by Matija Basanovic as his final project for 
the [Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Diploma](https://codeinstitute.net/). The project has been developed using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), with the goal of 
fulfilling the requirements of the final, Full-Stack Milestone Project of the Code Institute Full-Stack Software Developer Course.
This page is made after a lot of thinking and negotiation with the man name Seamus who owns the shops.
The purpose of the Rugby shop online page is to help bussines owner Seamus to sell some of his products on line during lockdown in Ireland coused by global pandemic call COVID-19. Because all his 50 shops are closed now, this is the only way for Seamus to sell some products and try to save a company and try bussines to continue.

All images displayed in project are stored in an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket, as are static files like CSS, icons and user-uploaded pictures.

The project is hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). A [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, also hosted at Heroku, is used to store image data and user data

## User Stories

A Visitor to The Rugby Shop website  expects/wants/needs:

1. As a creative, mindful person I would rather buy products from local shop to support small local business owners with a personal touch, instead of buying products from big companies.

2. As new visitor I want ability to search through small amounts of information to find what I need, and then be able to easily click to get more detailed information.
As new customer I dont want to be confused by the layout or process of payment, and be able to easy find what i am looking for.

4. In order to avoid unawareness of purchase, I want product information must be sufficiently clear to understand.

5. A text search function so that I can quickly narrow down my search when looking for something specific.I need To be able to see a summary of my order on every page of the checkout process. When I am logged in I can access my account details and update them if I need to. 
I expect to be able to find information on my past orders. 
I expect to be able to easily get in contact with the shop owner via a contact form.

## Design Choices

The Rugby Shop website has a stylistic design with discrete and warm colors, inspiring images and simple buttons.

### Fonts
- The primary font [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=me) provides an artistic feeling, but are at the same time easy to read, which I think suits the purpose of the page and itÂ´s audience.

My discrete & warm color design choices goes well together with the background image, and are listed here:

Color for the navbar | Color for the footer | Color for the New Collection carousel | Color for landing page | Color for about us text
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
#ec7211 | #ec7211 | #4c2b22 | #f8f9fa | #1a251a
