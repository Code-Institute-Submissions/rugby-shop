# Overview
[Rugby shop](https://rugby-shop.herokuapp.com/) was built and deployed by Matija Basanovic as his final project for 
the [Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Diploma](https://codeinstitute.net/). The project has been developed using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), with the goal of 
fulfilling the requirements of the final, Full-Stack Milestone Project of the Code Institute Full-Stack Software Developer Course.
This page is made after a lot of thinking and negotiation with the man name Seamus who owns the shops.
The purpose of the Rugby shop online page is to help bussines owner Seamus to sell some of his products on line during lockdown in Ireland coused by global pandemic call COVID-19. Because all his 50 shops are closed now, this is the only way for Seamus to sell some products and try to save a company and try bussines to continue.

All images displayed in project are stored in an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket, as are static files like CSS, icons and user-uploaded pictures.

The project is hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). A [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, also hosted at Heroku, is used to store image data and user data

# UX

## Goals

### Visitor Goals

The visitors that are targeted by Rugby Shop are:
- Professionals who are looking for good product for their team
- Amateurs that want to play a rugby in their favorite jersey
- People that want to get perfect birthay present
- People that are just bored becouse of COVID-19 and looking to spend some money

User goals are:
- Find a product that's gonna satisfied their needs 
- Buy from a trustworthy online shop.
- Show total price and number of items in cart.
- Be able to navigate the shop easily, find what I need and make a safe and secure purchase.


The online Rugby Shop is a great way to meet these needs because:
- The website has been designed to provide a clear view of product visitors are looking for.
- In navbar , visitors can find Home, Login and Register, Shop button with all products where they can search for specific product, Reviews and Cart
- Buyers can leave review if they are logged in

### Business Goals

The Goals of The Rugby Shop business are:
- Provide a professional online shop that helps the user to feel safe that they are buying from a trustworthy source. 
- Build brand awareness by including all the colors, fonts and logo associated with The Rugby Shop.
- Build Rugby Shop newsletter subscriptions.
- Fast and efficient delivery.
- Make sales of products easy for buyers to increase sales conversion.
- The presentation and layout of the site may not cause consternation, loss, or a desire to resign from shopping.

## User Stories

A Visitor to The Rugby Shop website  expects/wants/needs:

1. As a creative, mindful person I would rather buy products from local shop to support small local business owners with a personal touch, instead of buying products from big companies.

2. As new visitor I want ability to search through small amounts of information to find what I need, and then be able to easily click to get more detailed information.
As new customer I dont want to be confused by the layout or process of payment, and be able to easy find what i am looking for.

4. In order to avoid unawareness of purchase, I want product information must be sufficiently clear to understand.

5. A text search function so that I can quickly narrow down my search when looking for something specific.I need To be able to see a summary of my order on every page of the checkout process. When I am logged in I can access my account details and update them if I need to. 
I expect to be able to find information on my past orders. 
I expect to be able to easily get in contact with the shop owner via a contact form.

6. To be informed if I try to order more items than are available in stock.
Whenever a user adds an item to their cart or adjusts the quantity in their cart the current stock level for that item is checked from its database entry. A modal will alert the user if they attempt to add more to their cart than is available in stock, and their cart will be updated to reflect the maximum number available.

## Design Choices

The Rugby Shop website has a stylistic design with discrete and warm colors, inspiring images and simple buttons.

### Fonts
- The primary font [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=me) provides an artistic feeling, but are at the same time easy to read, which I think suits the purpose of the page and itÂ´s audience.

My discrete & warm color design choices goes well together with the background image, and are listed here:

Color for the navbar | Color for the footer | Color for the New Collection carousel | Color for landing page | Color for about us text
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
#ec7211 | #ec7211 | #4c2b22 | #f8f9fa | #1a251a

# Information Architecture

### Database Choice

- As a framework Django works with SQL databases. During development on my local machine I worked with the standard **sqlite3** database installed with Django.
- On deployment, the SQL database provided by Heroku is a **PostgreSQL** database. 

## Data Models

* In the `products` app I have this model: 
1. Product 
* In the `checkout` app I have these models:
1. Order
2. OrderItem
* In the `review` app I have this model:
1. Review

### User

The User model utilized for this project is the standard one provided by `django.contrib.auth.models`

### Products app model

Within the `products` app, the **Product** model holds all the data needed for the products in the shop.

### Languages
- This project uses:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

# Testing 

- Testing information can be found in product app in the folder "tests"
    - to run test in desired app write command in CLI:
        - coverage run --source=name of app manage.py test

#### How to run Python tests

To run the existing Python tests:
1. Activate your virtual environment.
2. In the terminal enter the following command:
```
python manage.py test
```
3. If you wish to run the tests within a specific app only you can specify with: 
```
python manage.py test <app name here>
```
4. The test results will be shown within the terminal.

_NOTE: The `python` part of these commands assumes you are working with a windows operating system. Your Python command may differ, such as `python3` or `py`_

### Travis

- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) was used throughout the unit testing of this project to provide continuous integration with the deployed site. The [Travis Documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) provides all the info needed to set it up.
- I set the heroku deployment settings for this project to only allow deployment when the travis had passed the latest push to the master branch on GitHub.

## Code Validation

- I used the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code.
    - The W3C Validator tool doesn't recognize the Jinja templating, which has resulted in it showing a lot of errors in relation to the Jinja code. However, all other code is validating fine.
- I used the [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.
- I used the [Pep8 Online tool](http://pep8online.com/) to validate my Python syntax.
- I used CLI to sort all my imports by using command  "isort -rc ."
- I used CLI to make sure line length is not going above 79 in one line by using command  "black --line-length=79"
- I used CLI to check all the errors in the code by using command  "flake8"
- I also removed some of the remaining errors manually

## Manual Testing

- I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I<br/> 
made to my project and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. <br/>
- I also tested my app on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure <br/>
it appeared in the desired way on different devices.
- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - developer tried to use this website to check responsiveness,
however Django has build in protection that does not allow to do it.

<br/>

## Deployment

### How to run this project locally

To run my code locally, users can download a local copy of my code to their desktop by completing the following steps:

1. Go to [my GitHub repository]https://github.com/MatijaBas/rugby-shop)
2. Click on 'Clone or download' under the repository name.
3. Copy the clone URL for the repository in the 'Clone with HTTPs section'.
4. Open 'Git Bash' in your local IDE.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, then paste the URL you copied in Step 3:

    ```git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY```

7. Press `Enter` to complete the process and create your local clone.
8. Complete one of the two below steps in your local workspace to set your own credentials for the environment variables:
    - Enter and save your own credentials in the `.baschrc` file; or
    - Create a `.env,py` file with your own credentials and import this into the `settings.py` file
9. Install the `requirements.txt` file by running the below command in your CLI Terminal:

    ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

10. Run one of the following commands in your Terminal to launch the Django project:

    ```python3 manage.py runserver```

11. Click the `http://` link that loads, and the project should load. If it doesn't load when you click the link, copy and paste it into a new browser tab instead.
12. Run the following commands to migrate the database models and create a super user:

    ```
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

13. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".
14. Set the following config vars in heroku :

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://rugby-shop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static/img/config-vars-heroku.jpg" alt="Rugby Shop configvars" aria-label="RugbyShop" />
</div>

<br/>

Once the migrations are completed and the super user has been created successfully, the site should be running locally.

### Media And Static Folders

During development, my `static` and `media` folders weren't pushed to GitHub only in the early parts of the project.
During the progress developer was instructed to keep them in .gitignore file, as they are hosted in my S3 bucket for

## Heroku Deployment

I used GitHub for my version control and Heroku to host the live version of my project. To deploy my website to Heroku, I used use the following steps:

1. Created the app in Heroku.
2. Went to the **Resources** tab in Heroku and searched for **Heroku Postgres** in the 'Add-Ons' section.
3. Selected the free **Hobby** level.
4. Updated the `.bashrc` file within my local workspace with the `DATABASE_URL` details, and the `settings.py` to connect to the database using the `dj_database_url` package.
5. Ran the `python3 manage.py makemigrations`, `python3 manage.py migrate`, `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` commands to migrate the models into Heroku Postgres and create a new super user in the new PostgreSQL database.
5. Went to the **Settings** tab in Heroku and clicked on the **Reveal Config Vars** button.
6. Copied and paste all of the default variables from env.py  in to Heroku's Config Vars section.

| Default quote | Your key | 
--- | --- 
os.environ.setdefault | "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "access_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY","secret_access_key_goes_here" |
os.environ.setdefault | "DATABASE_URL", "postgres://your postgres key, you get it from heroku") |
os.environ.setdefault | "EMAIL_ADDRESS","your_mail@gmail.com" | 
os.environ.setdefault | EMAIL_PASSWORD", "your_password" |
os.environ.setdefault | "SECRET_KEY", "secret_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE", "pk_test_your_key_goes_here" | 
os.environ.setdefault | "STRIPE_SECRET", "sk_test_dtripe_key_goes_here" | 
 
  
7. Went to the **Deploy** tab in Heroku, connected my app to my GitHub repository and selected **Enable Automatic Deployment** as the deployment method.
8. Went to the **Developers** section in Stripe and clicked on **API Keys**.
9. Copied and pasted the **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key** and set them as the `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE` and `STRIPE_SECRET` environment variables in the `.bashrc` file within my local workspace.
10. Updated the `settings.py` with the new Stripe environment variables.
11. Went to the **S3** section of AWS and created a new S3 bucket.
12. Updated the `settings.py` file in my local workspace with the relevant S3 bucket details:

    ```
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        "Expires": "Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT",
        "CacheControl": "max-age=94608000",
    }
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = "<s3-bucket-name>"
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = "<region-name>"
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = <access-key-id>
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = <secret-access-key>
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = "%s.s3.amazonaws.com" % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
    AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = None
    ```
13. Created a `custom_storages.py` file with classes to route to the relevant location settings for static and media files.
14. Updated the `settings.py` file with the relevant configuration for static and media file storage.
15. Ran the `python3 manage.py collectstatic` command to push the static files to my S3 bucket.
16. Created a requirements.txt file using the following command in the terminal window:

    ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```

17. Created a Procfile using the following command in the terminal window:

    ```web: gunicorn nutristore.wsgi:application> Procfile```

18. Ran the `git add .`, `git commit -m "<commit-message>"` and `git push` commands to push all changes to my GitHub repository.

The app was successfully deployed to Heroku at this stage.
